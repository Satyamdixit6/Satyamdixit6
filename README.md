# Satyam Dixit - Aspiring Deep Learning Engineer

## About Me

Hi there! I'm Satyam Dixit, an aspiring Deep Learning Engineer with a passion for pushing the boundaries of what's possible with machine learning. I'm excited to share my journey and the projects I've been working on.

## üöÄ Featured Projects

### 1. **Stable Diffusion Model (Text-to-Image)**

- **Description**: I've been working on a custom boilerplate for further training the Stable Diffusion model. I'm using ema.ckpt for inference and finetuning the model with both ema and non-ema.ckpt. I'm still figuring out quantization for the model.
- **Repository**: [Stable Diffusion Model](https://github.com/Satyamdixit6/stabke_diffusion_correct)

### 2. **Vision Model (Google Paligemma)**

- **Description**: In this project, I tried to introduce custom training kernels for kv_cache and attention heads, but unfortunately, I failed to implement it successfully.
- **Repository**: [Vision Model](https://github.com/Satyamdixit6/visionmodel_without_train)

### 3. **Graph Neural Network for Molecular Property Prediction**

- **Description**: I've been working on a Graph Neural Network (GNN) model to predict molecular properties. I've successfully implemented node and edge features to predict node features, but I'm still working on accurately predicting node connection types and features.
- **Repository**: [Graph Neural Network](https://github.com/Satyamdixit6)

## üå± Currently Learning

- **Quantization techniques** for efficient deployment of deep learning models
- **Reinforcement Learning** for decision-making and control tasks
- **Unsupervised Representation Learning** for data-efficient learning
